The legislation advances many of President Donald Trump’s top priorities, including extending the 2017 tax cuts enacted in his first term, expanding border enforcement, and implementing deep cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other federal programs. If enacted, it would significantly reshape the U.S. economy and federal government.

The vote follows weeks of intraparty disputes, as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) scrambled to broker enough compromises to unite a deeply fractured House GOP majority. Hardline conservatives, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, objected to the bill’s cost and demanded steeper spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and a faster start to new work requirements.

Meanwhile, Republicans from high-tax, high-income states threatened to walk unless the bill raised the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, forcing leadership into a difficult balancing act between fiscal conservatives and blue state moderates.
