Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, 78, was found guilty on all charges of conspiracy and sedition by a Hong Kong court under the national security law imposed by China.
Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper criticized the verdict, condemning it as politically motivated and an infringement on freedom of expression.
Lai has spent significant time in solitary confinement and faces potential life imprisonment, according to the trial judges.
The case has drawn international condemnation, with human rights groups and Western governments calling for his immediate release and opposing the national security law.
