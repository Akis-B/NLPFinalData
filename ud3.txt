On December 15, Hong Kong's High Court found Jimmy Lai guilty of multiple counts of seditious activity under the National Security Law in a trial seen as politically motivated.
Lai, who maintains his innocence, faces a potential life sentence for charges including sedition and collusion with foreign powers after his arrest in 2020.
The case has drawn international condemnation, with British officials urging the UK to make Lai's release a condition for improved relations with China.
Observers note that Lai's conviction reinforces the ongoing suppression of free speech in Hong Kong under increased governmental control, as highlighted by Freedom House.
