On Monday, December 15, the High Court found Jimmy Lai guilty of collusion and sedition at West Kowloon Law Courts Building, with sentencing upcoming.
Prosecutors argued Jimmy Lai used Apple Daily, now-shuttered newspaper, to publish seditious articles and lobby foreign governments for sanctions, with this campaign continuing before and after the National Security Law enactment.
The Court relied on contemporaneous WhatsApp and Signal messages, six accomplice prosecution witnesses, and found none discredited despite extensive cross-examination.
Sentencing is expected early next year; Western governments and rights groups called the trial politically motivated and demanded Lai's immediate release, while John Lee, Hong Kong chief executive, welcomed the verdict.
The ruling bookends a year that saw the Democratic Party disband, amid Apple Daily's closure and the NSL's nearly 100% conviction rate drawing international scrutiny of judicial independence.
