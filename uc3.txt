The United States Southern Command announced military strikes on three drug trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific, killing eight members of Designated Terrorist Organizations.
These strikes were authorized by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and confirmed by intelligence to target vessels using known narco-trafficking routes.
Since September, the U.S. military has carried out over 20 strikes, cumulatively killing around 90 suspected narco-terrorists, the report says.
Critics argue these military actions raise legal concerns, while supporters claim they are necessary to combat drug trafficking.
