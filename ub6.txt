NEWS BRIEF
France and Italy are leading a push to delay the final EU vote on a landmark 25-year-in-the-making trade deal with the Mercosur bloc, jeopardizing its completion. The move, driven by concerns over insufficient protections for European farmers against cheap South American imports, risks unraveling the agreement, which is seen as a crucial test of European unity and a strategic counterbalance to reliance on China and U.S. trade pressures.

WHAT HAPPENED
France and Italy are formally seeking to delay a final EU vote on the long-negotiated trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay).
The deal is the EU’s largest in terms of tariff relief and aims to open new export markets while reducing reliance on China and countering U.S. tariffs.
Key supporters include Germany, Spain, and Nordic countries, while Poland, Hungary, Austria, and Ireland also oppose or have reservations about the accord.
The European Commission insists the deal is geopolitically and economically urgent and still aims to sign it by year-end.
WHY IT MATTERS
The delay threatens to derail a quarter-century of negotiations, undermining the EU’s credibility as a unified global trade actor.
It highlights deep divisions within the bloc between free-trade proponents and member states prioritizing agricultural protectionism.
The deal is strategically framed as a way to strengthen the EU’s geopolitical relevance and diversify trade partnerships amid growing U.S.-China tensions.
Failure to reach an agreement could leave European exporters vulnerable to Trump’s tariffs and Chinese competition without new market access.
IMPLICATIONS
If Denmark proceeds with a vote this week, France appears to have enough support to form a blocking minority, which would effectively kill the deal.
A collapse could signal weakened EU cohesion and diminish Brussels’ ability to negotiate future trade agreements.
European farmers may gain short-term protection, but exporters could lose long-term opportunities in South American markets.
The delay reinforces the growing influence of domestic agricultural lobbies on EU trade policy, potentially setting a precedent for future deals.
