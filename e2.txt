The European Commission on Friday issued a landmark €120 million fine to Elon Musk-owned X for breaching transparency requirements of the Digital Services Act (DSA).

The fine, the equivalent of about $140 million and the first issued under the European Union's DSA, is linked to the "deceptive design of its ‘blue checkmark', the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers," the EU release states.

The "blue checkmark" is front-and-center in the ruling, stating that the once-free, now-paid checkmark deceives users and violates the DSA requirement to prohibit deceptive design practices. The blue checkmark now makes it difficult to verify authentic accounts and makes it easier for users to be scammed, according to the ruling.

"While the DSA does not mandate user verification, it clearly prohibits online platforms from falsely claiming that users have been verified, when no such verification took place," the ruling states.

The ruling also cites a lack of transparency within X's ad repository, stating that it has limited information about the content of advertisements and who is paying for them, which makes it difficult for researchers and the public to scrutinize.


AD
X also failed to provide researchers access to public data as required by DSA.

The ruling follows a nearly two-year investigation launched in December 2023 to determine whether X violated DSA requirements related to the spread of illegal content and the effectiveness of its efforts to combat misinformation, the release states.

"Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU," said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for European Commission for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy.


AD
X now has 60 business days to bring forward plans to address its use of blue checkmarks, 90 days to address EU concerns regarding its ad repository and public data access to researchers or face further fines, according to the ruling.

Meta is delaying the release of its anticipated mixed reality headset, codename "Phoenix," and will focus on next-gen devices and wearables over the next year.

In an internal memo, Reality Labs Vice President Maher Saba stated that the commands originated from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who instructed Reality Labs teams to focus on "higher quality experiences" and other efforts to make the business more sustainable. Saba clarified to employees that the extended timeline was not due to the device receiving additional features, but rather to encourage teams to refine the details.

Other Meta VR leaders, including Reality Labs executives Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns, added that the decision would give them more "breathing room" to complete the product, as reported by Business Insider. "There's a lot coming in hot with tight bring-up schedules and big changes to our core UX, and we won't compromise on landing a fully polished and reliable experience," they wrote in another memo.

The glasses reportedly look similar to Apple's Vision Pro glasses, with a goggle-like shape and an external computing puck that makes the unit extremely lightweight. Insiders say it will run on the same Horizon OS as Meta’s Quest headsets.

Meta will instead aim for a 2026 release of a "limited edition" wearable device, called "Malibu 2," as well as a next-generation Meta Quest device. Aul and Cairns said the revamp will include a major capabilities upgrade focused on immersive gaming.
