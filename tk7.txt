WASHINGTON 

US President Donald Trump on Thursday hailed the House of Representatives’ passage of a sweeping tax and spending bill.

"This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

His remarks came after the lower chamber narrowly passed 'The One, Big, Beautiful Bill' in a 215-214 vote after days of meetings and negotiations.

"The Bill includes MASSIVE Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for the Golden Dome, ‘TRUMP Savings Accounts’ for newborn babies, and much more!" said the president.

Trump also heralded House Speaker Mike Johnson and every Republican who voted for the "historic" bill.

The president pushed the Senate to "get to work" and send the bill to his desk "as soon as possible" to be signed.
