President Donald Trump made a startling threat on his social media platform Tuesday evening as he announced a dramatic escalation of pressure against Venezuela's government.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, "Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America."

He characterized the military show of force as a prelude to a more ominous action.

"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before — Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us," said Trump.

Trump called the regime of Nicolás Maduro "illegitimate," and accused the government of using oil from "stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping."

In his announcement, Trump vowed a "TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela."

Additionally, Trump asserted that any illegal immigrants sent to America by the regime would be returned at a "rapid pace."

His rant concluded with a demand for the immediate return of "our Oil, Land, or any other Assets."

In the past few weeks, Trump has repeatedly issued explicit threats against Venezuela, including promising imminent land strikes. He has also declared that Maduro’s "days are numbered."
