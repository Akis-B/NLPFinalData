In recent weeks, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released tens of thousands of documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, reams of emails and photographs that have provided additional details about the private life of the sex-trafficking financier and the prominent people in his orbit. The committee says it received 95,000 new images from the estate on Thursday and has now released 19 photos that depict Epstein with several high-profile figures, including Donald Trump, former president Bill Clinton, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. However, the panel did not include captions describing who or what is depicted in the photos or when or where they were taken. “These disturbing images raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world,” the committee Democrats wrote on social media. Here, what’s included in the new tranche of photos and what we’ve been able to discern about them.

 Trump with unknown women
In one photo, Trump is smiling surrounded by six women whose faces have been redacted. In another, Trump is seated aboard a plane next to a blonde woman whose face has also been obscured.

 Epstein with Donald Trump at a Victoria’s Secret event
One image depicts a younger Trump standing beside Epstein and a laughing blonde woman at what appears to be a public event. CBS News notes that Trump and Epstein were photographed together at a Victoria’s Secret “Angel’s Party” in New York, which the estate-released photo appears to resemble.

 Trump-themed condoms
Another image shows a pile of novelty Trump condoms for sale in the Manhattan home-goods store Fishs Eddy.

 Epstein with Bill Clinton
The estate released an image of a photo signed by Clinton. In the photo, Clinton can seen standing next to Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell as well as Epstein himself.

 Photos of Bill Gates
In one photo, Gates is pictured next to Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the son of Queen Elizabeth II, whose association with Epstein and related allegations resulted in the loss of his royal titles. In another, Gates is seen standing in front of a plane beside an unknown pilot. Another image shows a framed photo of Gates, apparently aboard a plane, on a wall above a credenza.

 Epstein with Steve Bannon
Trump adviser Steve Bannon is included in multiple photos. In one, Bannon is seated across from Epstein, who is behind a desk in what appears to be his office. In the other image, Bannon and Epstein can be seen taking a mirror selfie together. Bannon is also pictured talking with Woody Allen in a separate image, which Epstein also had a framed copy of on a credenza inside his mansion, per the New York Times.

One photo shows Epstein speaking with the director, who is sitting in a director’s chair, on an unknown set. Another shows Epstein, Allen, and a woman whose face is redacted sitting around a dinner table.

 Epstein with Richard Branson
In one image, Epstein is seen in an apparent outdoor tropical location with British billionaire Richard Branson, who is holding up a notebook with unidentifiable writing on it. Another shot of Epstein and Branson, apparently taken this same day, is among the framed photos Epstein had on a credenza in his mansion, per images the New York Times published in August.

 Will any more images be released from this trove?
That’s entirely possible but not yet clear.
