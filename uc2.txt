Monday's strikes in the eastern Pacific, the military said, reportedly targeted three boats accused of drug smuggling, killing eight people.
The campaign has built the U.S. military's largest regional presence in decades, targeting smuggling routes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, while ramping up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and seizing a sanctioned oil tanker last week.
The military said the strikes targeted `designated terrorist organizations` and posted video of a boat exploding but did not provide publicly released evidence of alleged drug trafficking.
On the eve of briefings, lawmakers on Capitol Hill intensify scrutiny of a campaign that has killed at least 95 people in 25 known strikes since early September.
President Donald Trump has framed the strikes as part of an `armed conflict` with drug cartels and said land attacks are 'coming soon', while Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro insists the operations aim to oust him.
