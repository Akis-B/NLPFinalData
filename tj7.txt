US President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an extended rebuttal to any suggestion that he is slowing down, declaring himself in “perfect” physical and cognitive health and accusing The New York Times of spreading “fake” reports about his age and stamina. In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump said, “There has never been a President that has worked as hard as me,” adding that his hours were “the longest” and his results “among the best.”

He listed what he claimed were his major achievements, including ending “Eight Wars,” creating the “Greatest Economy in the History of our Country,” rebuilding the military, enacting the “Largest Tax Cuts and Regulation Cuts, EVER,” closing the southern border, and cultivating global respect for the United States.

In addition to these achievements, Trump stressed his medical and cognitive examinations. Trump said he regularly undergoes “long, thorough, and very boring Medical Examinations” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre and claimed doctors had given him “PERFECT Marks.” He also said he had taken three cognitive tests, including one recently, and had “aced” all of them “in front of large numbers of doctors and experts.”

Trump said that few people could perform similarly and said previous presidents had declined to take such tests, adding, “I will know when I am slowing up, but it’s not now.”




PAST PROCEDURES AND PUBLIC SCRUTINY
Trump has previously shared limited information about medical procedures, prompting questions about his health. During a recent trip to Asia, he revealed that he had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at Walter Reed in early October. Asked about it, Trump told reporters he did not know exactly what was analysed, but insisted the results were “as good as they’ve ever seen.”

Observers have noted other physical indicators, including a bruise on the back of his right hand – which aides and his physician attribute to taking aspirin and frequent handshakes – as well as swollen ankles. Speculation about his health circulated widely online in September because of these visible signs.

Trump reportedly does not exercise regularly, citing a belief that people have a finite energy reserve. He continues to consume red meat and fast food and frequently comments on weight-loss drugs, though it is unclear whether he uses them himself.

NYT REPORT QUESTIONS TRUMP'S PUBLIC SCHEDULE
Trump’s post comes after a November 25 New York Times article noting that his public schedule has narrowed during his second term. The paper said most appearances fall between noon and 5 pm, domestic travel has decreased, and at a November 6 Oval Office event, Trump appeared to doze off while seated as executives discussed weight-loss drugs.

Trump rejected the reporting, calling it a “hit piece” and accusing The New York Times of spreading “fake reports” and being “seditious, perhaps even treasonous.” He described the newspaper as an “Enemy of the People” and said it should “cease publication.”

WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the president’s health and transparency. “Unlike the Biden White House, who covered up Joe Biden’s cognitive decline and hid him from the press, President Trump and his entire team have been open and transparent about the president’s health, which remains exceptional,” she said.

At 79, Trump is the oldest person elected to the presidency. Critics question whether age affects his energy, while Trump emphasizes results, medical evaluations, and stamina. His rebuttal signals that he intends to defend both his record and physical fitness ahead of the 2026 midterms and upcoming domestic and international engagements.
