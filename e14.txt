The globalist technocratic authoritarians in Brussels just hit Elon Musk’s X with a €120 million ($140 million), the first blood drawn under their Digital Services Act.

This isn’t about “transparency”—it’s an unabashed power grab to muzzle what is perhaps the most influential social platform that still lets normal people speak.

EU paper-pushers whined that X’s paid blue-check system “confuses” users about who’s verified. In other words, they’re furious that anyone who can pay $8 can now get the same badge the old regime used to hand out only to approved regime journalists.

EU globalists complain that X won’t open its data firehose wide enough for their taxpayer-funded, regime-aligned ‘researchers.’ Everyone knows these “experts” are just left-liberal activists looking for new excuses to de-platform patriots, populists, nationalists, conservatives, and really anyone who has the nerve to go against the regime.

This fine is only round one of a two-year persecution campaign. More show trials are coming over “illegal content” and “manipulation”—code words the EU uses whenever conservatives trend.

It’s worth noting, however, that unlike the vast majority of European countries, America still has leaders with a spine. JD Vance immediately called this attack what it is: Brussels punishing X for refusing to censor right-wing voices on demand.

“Rumors swirling that the EU commission will fine X hundreds of millions of dollars for not engaging in censorship. The EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage,” he wrote on X yesterday.

Musk hasn’t dignified the Eurocrats with a formal reply, but he signaled loud and clear that he’s with Vance. Meanwhile, EU digital commissar Henna Virkkunen, who nobody outside the Brussels’ bubble has even heard of, pretends this is just routine law enforcement. Is anyone buying that boldface lie, though?

Meanwhile, Brussels officials treat Chinese TikTok completely differently. The EU closed its TikTok probe with zero fine after the Chinese app promised a few cosmetic changes—proof that obedience gets you mercy, while defiance gets you crushed.

Under the DSA, these unelected bureaucrats can steal up to 6% of a company’s worldwide revenue. That’s not regulation; that’s legalized extortion aimed squarely at American companies that won’t kneel.

Should we really be surprised, though, at the globalist bloc’s thievery? The EU has been doing its utmost to steal hundreds of billions of dollars in “frozen Russian assets” for years now.

Interestingly, when reporters asked how they calculated the €120 million shakedown, the EU Commission refused to show the math.

The same people screaming for “transparency” suddenly go silent when it’s their own books on the line. In all likelihood, the EU simply needs a hundred million to help prop up an economy they’ve diligently destroyed over the past decade.

Socialist MEPs, unsurprisingly, are cheering this crackdown like it’s 1956 in Budapest. They openly brag that the DSA will finally force every platform to adopt the same woke censorship they’ve long demanded.

American officials have warned for years that the DSA is just European authoritarian socialism by backdoor regulation. Now Vance is saying out loud what everyone knows: Brussels hates any platform that won’t ban conservatives on command.

EU spokesmen keep parroting that the DSA is about “transparency, not censorship.” It could not be clearer that the only platforms getting sanctioned are the ones that still allow free speech.

This war on X exposes the real face of the globalist superstate: an authoritarian empire that will attempt to bankrupt anyone who refuses to bow to its system of thought control. Increasingly, anti-globalists everywhere now see Brussels for the Soviet-style monster it has become.
