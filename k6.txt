Tokyo | Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai was convicted on Monday under the city’s national security law, in a landmark case that critics say underscores the erosion of civil liberties in the Chinese-ruled financial hub.

The High Court found Lai, the 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct news outlet Apple Daily, guilty of colluding with foreign forces and publishing seditious material. Lai, who has denied all charges, faces the possibility of a life sentence.

The conviction caps more than five years of legal proceedings and follows more than 1800 days of detention, much of it in solitary confinement. Around 100 supporters gathered outside the West Kowloon courthouse in Hong Kong from the early hours, while heavy police presence capped off a case that has drawn sustained international scrutiny.

Western governments and human rights groups have long argued the prosecution was politically motivated, pointing to Lai’s outspoken criticism of Beijing and his role in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Representatives from the US, UK and Canadian consulates were present in court, according to local media.

Lai’s family and legal team have raised concerns about his health, while human rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly called for his release.

A devout Catholic, Lai has been held in a cell with a small window facing onto a corridor, according to his family. Those close to him say his faith has helped steel his fight in court and against the Chinese Communist Party.

Hong Kong authorities have rejected accusations that the trial is politically motivated, accusing foreign governments of interfering in the city’s legal affairs. The government said Lai had received adequate medical care and that the judiciary remained independent.

Lai is a self-made businessman whose rise from poverty to prominence mirrored Hong Kong’s postwar boom. Born in mainland China, he fled to Hong Kong in 1961 as a penniless teenager, later building a garment manufacturing business that grew into the Giordano clothing chain across Asia.

His political awakening followed China’s 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, after which Lai increasingly turned to journalism and activism.

He sold Giordano in the mid-1990s after its mainland operations were targeted and used the proceeds in 1995 to found Apple Daily, a brash, populist tabloid that mixed crime, celebrity and investigative reporting while openly criticising Beijing and Hong Kong’s leadership.

After Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, Lai was arrested following police raids on Apple Daily’s newsroom.

Once listed among Forbes’ 40 wealthiest Hong Kong people with a fortune of $HK1.2 billion in 2008, his assets were frozen in 2021, forcing the paper to shut down. Lai has remained in custody since December 2020.

National security law
The businessman turned opposition activist is the most prominent figure yet to be prosecuted under the national security law imposed by Beijing in June 2020.

He and the three companies he owned, namely Apple Daily, Apple Daily Printing and AD Internet, were charged under the national security law.

The case has drawn international attention at the highest political levels. A bipartisan group of US politicians recently moved to designate a “Jimmy Lai Day”, while US President Donald Trump has said he raised Lai’s detention with Chinese President Xi Jinping and claimed he could secure his release if re-elected.

Legal scholars say the trial marks a decisive shift in how law functions in Hong Kong.

Eric Yan-ho Lai, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Centre for Asian Law, said the trial was “more like a show, a theatre for Beijing and the court to tell the world that he is a criminal”.

“The law was expected to be neutral, impartial. They will punish people, but they can also punish the government if they are doing misconduct,” he said.

However, “under the Chinese rule since 1997, they want to reshape this idea to say that the law is really a tool for the government to control and regulate society”, while showing “the supremacy of the government”.

The verdict also comes amid a broader crackdown on dissent.

The closure of Apple Daily in 2021, the arrest of dozens of activists and politicians, and the decision by Hong Kong’s Democratic Party this week to disband have accelerated the city’s slide down global press-freedom rankings.
