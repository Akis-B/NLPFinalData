The Secret Service warned a federal judge Monday that halting President Trump’s controversial White House ballroom construction could compromise presidential security, as the administration faces a lawsuit over the project’s legality. The National Trust for Historic Preservation is seeking a temporary restraining order to stop construction, arguing Trump violated federal law by failing to obtain required approvals before demolishing the East Wing.
Government lawyers told Judge Richard Leon that ballroom designs remain in progress, making the lawsuit premature. Secret Service Deputy Director Matthew Quinn said contractors are racing to install temporary security measures following the East Wing’s demolition, completed earlier this month. He indicated these measures are classified but offered to brief the judge privately.

The trust contends Trump broke the law by not submitting plans to two federal commissions and Congress before starting work, and by skipping environmental reviews. Attorney Gregory Craig argued the project represents “the most substantial exterior alteration to the country’s most recognizable and historically significant building since it was reconstructed after being burned during the War of 1812.”
Trump, leveraging his real estate background, initially planned a 90,000-square-foot ballroom but has since announced the project will be “double the size” with upgraded finishes and interiors. He claims the work is under budget and ahead of schedule, funded entirely by private donations with no taxpayer money involved.
The demolished East Wing, constructed in 1902 alongside the West Wing, was expanded in 1942 to include a bunker and movie theater. The construction also destroyed the historic garden dating to 1903, later renamed for former first lady Jackie Kennedy in 1965.
The lawsuit identifies the National Capital Planning Commission and Commission of Fine Arts as bodies that should review the plans, though neither has seen them. Trump dismissed all Fine Arts Commission members, leaving that board empty. Federal law also requires congressional approval for projects on federal parkland in Washington.

Justice Department lawyer Mark Widerschein argued the trust should wait until final plans are submitted before objecting, suggesting concerns might be resolved without court intervention. Underground work will continue for months, with above-grade construction not starting until April at earliest.

The National Park Service defended the project, saying the alternative—erecting tents for large events—causes substantial grass damage requiring repeated repairs. Officials said they preserved historic items from the East Wing, performed 3D scanning, and saved stone columns, doors, historic fencing, light fixtures, and an IM Pei-designed pergola for incorporation into the new building.
