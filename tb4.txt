Watch: Donald Trump Jr. and Bettina Anderson Are Engaged
Donald Trump Jr. and Bettina Anderson are taking the next step. 

President Donald Trump announced his eldest son's engagement during a holiday party held at the White House Dec. 15. In a video shared to X, Donald Jr. himself also shared insight into his next chapter.

“It’s not often that I’m at a loss for words, 'cause we usually do the ranting and raving really well,” the 47-year-old told the crowd. “But this is a little different. But I just want to wish you guys an incredible holiday season, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year.”

Giving a shoutout to his now-fiancée—who wore a sparkling red dress for the occasion—Donald Jr. added, “And to thank Bettina for that one word, ‘yes.’”

Donald Jr. also noted that his engagement is a “big win for the end of the year,” before turning the floor over to Bettina.

“This has really been the most unforgettable weekend of my life,” the 39-year-old said. “And I get to marry the love of my life. And I just feel like the luckiest girl in the world.”
